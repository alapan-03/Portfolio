This is a portfolio website project. It is developed by dividing every part like the home page, about page, portfolio page and the contact page into different sections. There is a seperate file for CSS named styles.css and a seperate file for JavaScript named myscripts.js. Although there is a seperate folder for css, inline styles has been used for the development of this project.

Note - In order to demonstrate the project, intro.html file should be the root file i.e. it should be opened first.
